# My Minestom Server
[Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) is an open-source library that enables developers to create their own Minecraft server software, without any code from Mojang.

This is my server using Minestom. It will probably never be used for anything, but it's mainly a way for me to learn to make servers using Minestom.
